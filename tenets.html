        <p>Along with my blog writing, I take lots of miscellaneous notes on a daily basis – about things I see that are interesting, goals I have, foods I like, etc.</p>
        <p>One category of notes is what I call my "tenets". A tenet is a "principle or belief, especially one of the main principles of a religion or philosophy". My list of tenets are sort of like my personal philosophy of life, things I feel to be true based on a combination of all my life experiences and learnings to date.</p>
        <p>This is a "living" list, I am continually revising, updating, and adding to it, as each new day, hour, minute, second, brings new experiences and knowledge.</p>
        <p><i>I believe you can never know anything 100% for sure. My beliefs are held as certainty percentages which are constantly being updated based on new information, knowledge, and experiences. Nothing is black and white. Everything is a balance with subtleties, and that’s where the human element comes in I believe. Bayes theory applies: yesterday’s a posteriori is today’s a priori.</i></p>
        <p><i>Train the mind to think beyond the immediate exchange. Think about the legacy impacts of words or actions.</i></p>
        <p><i>Have to lean into change instead of leaping into change in order to have a better chance of sticking with it.</i></p>
