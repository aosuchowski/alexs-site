        <p><strong>Hello!</strong>I am Alex and this is my personal website. You have made it here, so welcome to my little corner of the internet. I am using this space as place to organize and share some of my ideas and interests. It is a place I enjoy visiting and working on, and if you find it interesting too, then that's great.</p>
        <p>My interests include being in the great outdoors surrounded by nature, reading and writing, gardening, cooking, playing sports, traveling, computer programming, and above all I love learning and exploring new things.</p>
        <p>If you're interested, you can read a few things <a href="about.html" style="text-decoration: underline;">about</a> me, and what I'm doing <a href="now.html" style="text-decoration: underline;">now</a>.</p>
        <p>I love to write. And I especially love to write if it is helpful or interesting for others. I've started a couple <a href="blogs.html" style="text-decoration: underline;">blogs</a> which you are welcome to check out.</p>
        <p> Along with my blog writing, I take lots of miscellaneous notes on a daily basis â€“ about things I see that are interesting, goals I have, foods I like, dreams I have, etc. One category of notes is what I call my "<a href="tenets.html" style="text-decoration: underline;">tenets</a>". A tenet is a "principle or belief, expecially one of the main principles of a religion or philosophy". My list of tenets are sort of like my personal philosophy of life, things I feel to be true based on a combination of all my life experiences and learnings to date. This is a "living" list, I am continually revising, updating, and adding to it, as each new day, hour, minute, second, brings new experiences and knowledge.</p>
        <p>I also love gardening. And I like computers too. So naturally, I had to make my own <a href="digital-garden.html" style="text-decoration: underline;">digital garden ðŸŒ»</a>. Right now it is a work in (coding) progress. Once the ground has been dug, and compost mixed in the topsoil, I intend to use it as a place to collect anything I come across that I wish to save â€“ pictures, ideas, book recommendations, recipes, etc. It is likely to only make sense to me, but you can have a look around if you'd like, it's a garden after all.</p>
